# Oh Craps! for iOS

An app that holds my compendium of Craps strategies that I currently have hosted up on my [Oh Craps! Strategies site.](https://marconius.com/craps/)

## App Features

* Searchable and filterable list of 160 Craps strategies.
* List has alphabetized headings for easier and accessible navigation.
* Filter by Buy-in amounts or Table Minimums.
* Each strategy has the Buy-in amount, Table Minimum, Notes, and the step-by-step guide to playing out the entire strategy.
* Accessibility-focused and WCAG 2.2 and Apple HIG conformant.
* Fun Craps table color theming to match the online site.


## Roadmap

* Adding in a Rules section for easy reference when out and about or at a casino.
* Rules tab will also contain common terms, slang, etiquette, and references for payouts and odds.
* Giving users the ability to check favorite strategies.
