<ol>
<li>Make a $15 Pass Line bet. Once point is established, wait one roll to avoid a Point Seven Out.</li>
<li>Bet $5 times the 3x4x5 Pass Line Odds depending on the point; bet $15 in odds for the 4 or 10, $20 in odds for the 5 or 9, and $25 in odds for the 6 or 8.</li>
<li>Pick either the 6 or 8 and place it with an equivalent value to the Pass Line bet plus the odds; place the 6 or 8 for $30 if the point is 4 or 10, $36 if the point is 5 or 9, or $42 if the point is 6 or 8.</li>
<li>If the placed 6 or 8 hits, take down both your place bet and the pass line odds and wait for the hand to resolve.</li>
<li>If the point is hit, take down the place bet and start strategy over.</li>
</ol>
