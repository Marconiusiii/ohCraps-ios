<li>Place $30 each on the 6 and 8. Bet $10 on the Pass Line Odds.</li>
<li>If the 6 hits, you'll win $35. Use the winnings to cover the 3, 4, and 5 with $10 bets. Buy the 3 and 4 if possible. If the 8 hits instead, use the winnings to cover the 9, 10, and 11 with $10 bets and buy the 10 and 11.</li>
<li>On the next hit, use some of the winnings to cover either the 2 or 12 depending on which number has hit downtown or uptown. Collect the rest.</li>
