<h3>7 Heaven</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $250</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $25+</p>
<p>Notes: Quick grind system for short money on higher limit tables. Adjust bankroll based on the bets you are making.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by laying the 6 and 8 for $30 each on the Come Out roll.</li>
<li>If the shooter throws a winning 7, you'll win $50 minus the vig.</li>
<li>If a point is established, take down the Lay bets and play any other system or wait for the next come out roll before repeating this system.</li>
<li>The larger the bets, the more you'll win in a shorter amount of time while still being able to cheer on the shooter for a 7 winner on the come out roll. Anything lower than $30 each on the Lay 6 and 8 will take forever to grind out a win, so try to stick with this as the baseline/lowest bet.</li>
</ol>
