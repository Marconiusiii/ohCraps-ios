<h3>$86 Across</h3> 
<p>Buy-in: $600</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $5-$10</p> 
<ol>
<li>Wait for a point or start out with $86 across; $10 each on the 4 and 10, and $66 inside.</li> 
<li>Make a $1 Any Craps bet with each roll. Alternatively, cover the C & E or go $3 Craps and $2 Eleven.</li> 
<li>Collect the first 3 hits, then regress bets to a level below the profits you've made. If you hit 3 Place numbers while making $1 Crap check bets every hit, you'll have a profit of $60. Regress bets down to $22 Inside and play on from there.</li>
<li>Let bets ride and collect hits, then press up as you see fit. Recommend moving into double-tap or triple-lux press system after collecting one or two hits from $22 Inside.</li>
