<h3>The Arnold</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $600-$1000</p>
<p>Table Minimum: Any</p>
<p>Notes: Simple strategy that is scalable based on any table minimum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bet 1 unit on the Pass Line.</li>
<li>When a point is established, bet 4 units on the Don't Come. For a $15 table, this would be $60.</li>
<li>Once the Don't Come is established, make a 1 unit Come bet for every roll after until a 7 Out or the Don't Come falls.</li>
<li>If the Don't Come falls, replace it before starting to make Come bets again.</li>
</ol>
