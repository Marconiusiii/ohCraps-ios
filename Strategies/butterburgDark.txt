<ol>
<li>Start with a $100 Don't Pass bet. Set up the Bruce's Back Wall bet by Laying the 4 and 10 for $200 each, the 5 and 9 for $150 each, and the 6 and 8 for $120 each, all working.</li>
<li>If a 7 rolls on the Come Out, you'll win $500 net, so feel free to call it a day right there.</li>
<li>If a Point is established, immediately lay $600 in odds against that number and take down all the Lay bets or turn them off and wait for the 7 out.</li>
