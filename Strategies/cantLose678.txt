<h3>6 7 8 Can't Lose</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $300</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $5-$15</p>
<p>Notes: This strategy definitely can lose, but it is banking on the highest probability numbers rolling. Meant for choppy tables. Buy-in set for 3 shooters, adjust as necessary.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a $40 Don't Pass bet.</li>
<li>Once point is established, bet $18 each on the Place 6 and 8.</li>
<li>Let bets ride until a 7 out. After 2 hits on the 6 or 8, you can take down the Don't Pass bet and anything further becomes pure profit. Feel free to press or spread winnings to other numbers as the 6 and 8 continue to hit.</li>
<li>Repeat strategy after a 7 out. Hold off on playing this strategy if you encounter a shooter who is good at hitting their points.</li>
</ol>
