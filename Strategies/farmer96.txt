<h3>Farmer 96</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $1000</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $5-$10</p>
<p>Notes: Pressing from $96 Across to end up collecting $50 for $1 with each box number hit.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wait for a Point to be established.</li>
<li>Place $96 Across; $15 each on the 4, 5, 9, and 10, and $18 each on the 6 and 8. Make a $10 Field bet.</li>
<li>When any of the numbers hit, use the winnings to press the number up feeding the press with the Field win if any, and use any leftover winnings to press other box numbers. Aim to get the 4 and 10 pressed up to $25 each, the 5 and 9 pressed up to $35 each, and the 6 and 8 up to $42 each.</li>
<li>If the 5 hits, press it up to $25 and use the rest of the winnings to replace the $10 Field bet.</li>
<li>If the 6 or 8 hit, drop in $1 to press the bet up to $30 and use the rest of the winnings to replace the $10 Field bet.</li>
<li>Always press up the number that hits first, then use extra winnings to press up the 6 and 8, then the 5 and 9, and then the 4 and 10.</li>
<li>Once all numbers are pressed up, take down the Field bet. You will now be winning $50 for $1 with each box number hit.</li>
<li>Let bets ride until a 7 out, or feel free to move into any collect and press system that you like.</li>
