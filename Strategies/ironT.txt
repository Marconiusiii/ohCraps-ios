<h3>The Iron T Regression</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $600-$1400</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $5-$10</p>
<p>Notes: Modified Iron Cross that removes the 5 and starts with a high outlay, then regresses for a strategy that costs only $20.</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the 6 and 8 for $60 each, and make a $20 Field bet. Have these working on the Come Out, or wait for a point to be established. The strategy will be the same either way.</li>
<li>If the Field bet loses, replace it with the same amount that just lost.</li>
<li>After one hit on the 6 or 8, or after 3 Field hits, regress the 6 and 8 down to $30 each and take the Field bet down to $10.</li>
<li>At this point, feel free to ride these bets, or go to $64 across and take down the Field bet and change to a press and collect system.</li>
</ol>
