<h3>Opposites Attract</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $1000</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $5-$10</p>
<p>Notes: Uses the 6 and 8 to press the outside numbers, and vice versa to get you up to big paid-off bets in a few hits.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a $10 Pass Line bet.</li>
<li>When the Point is established, bet $110 Across but in a pyramid: $10 each on the 4 and 10, $15 each on the 5 and 9, and $3- each on the 6 and 8.</li>
<li>If the 6 or 8 hit first, drop in $5 and use that plus the $35 winnings to press the 4, 5, 9, and 10 up $10 each, so you'll have $20 each on the 4 and 10, and $25 each on the 5 and 9.</li>
<li>Or, if the 5 or 9 hit first, drop in $3 and use that plus the $21 winnings to press the 6 and 8 up $12 each, so bring them to $42 each.</li>
<li>Or, if the 4 or 10 hit first, drop in $5 to add to the $19 winnings to do the same $12 each press on the 6 and 8.</li>
<li>Now, if any pressed number hits, immediately collect the winnings and regress the bet down to the table minimum, assuming you are on a $10 table. You'll now have half of your outlay paid for.</li>
<li>You can keep collecting from the non-pressed numbers, or use the hits to press up the opposite numbers until one hits. So let hits on the 6 or 8 feed the presses of the 4, 5, 9, and 10, and let hits on the outside numbers feed presses on the 6 and 8.</li>
<li>Once you've collected and regressed on two numbers, or hit twice on the un-pressed numbers, start any collect and press system that you like.</li>
<li>Restart the system on a 7 out.</li>
</ol>
