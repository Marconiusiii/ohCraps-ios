<h3>Pass &amp; Props</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $500</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $5-$15</p>
<p>Notes: Risky but fun system to enjoy the most out of your time at the table.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a $15 Pass Line bet.</li>
<li>Once point is established, bet max odds behind the Pass Line bet. Place the 5 and 9 for $15 each. Bet $5 each on all of the Hard Ways bets.</li>
<li>Let all bets ride until a 7 out. Replace hard ways bets if they fall, and just same bet the place numbers if they hit.</li>
<li>If the 5 or 9 becomes the point, move that place bet to the 6 or 8 and drop in $3 to make it a proper $18 place bet.</li>
</ol>
