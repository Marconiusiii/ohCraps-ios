<h3>Quarter Pounder with Ease</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $1000-$1500</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $10</p>
<p>Notes: Initial outlay of $165, so $1650 would be the total amount needed for 10 shooters. $500 can work for 3 shooters.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wait for a point to be established.</li>
<li>Place the 6 and 8 for $60 each. Bet $35 on the Field, and hop the 5s for $10.</li>
<li>Collect on whatever rolls for the next 2 hits, replacing the Field and Hop 5s if they fall. If you hit any of these bets, you'll collect $25 in your rack after replenishing any fallen bets.</li>
<li>After 2 hits, you'll have made $50 or over, so take down all your bets and change to $44 inside on the place bets. No matter what, you'll have profit from this point on.</li>
<li>Start collecting and pressing for the rest of the hand. Feel free to spread out to the 4 and 10 if the shooter seems to hit them often. Try doing a half press on the first place bet hit to take back some more profit, then do a full press on the second hit. Double-tap or triple-lux will work from this point on as well.</li>
