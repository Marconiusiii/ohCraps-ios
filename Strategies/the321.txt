<h3>3-2-1 Low Roller</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $360-$400</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $5</p>
<ol>
<li>Minimum pass line bet.</li>
<li>When point is established:
	<ul role="list">

	<li>5 and 9: 2x Pass Line Odds</li>
	<li>6 and 8: 3x Pass Line Odds</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Bet minimum bets on inside numbers. Skip any number if it is the Point and covered by Pass Line bet.</li>
<li>If Point is 4 or 10, turn all Place Bets off after two hits, otherwise turn Place Bets off after 3 hits if Point is any other number.</li>
<li>After Place Bets are off, let shooter roll until hitting the Point or a 7 Out., then start strategy over.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Alternate Method</h4>
<p>Much more volatile, but can lead to large wins on a hot roll.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a $10 Pass Line bet.</li>
<li>Use same Odds numbers from above. 3x Odds on 6 and 8, 2x Odds on 5 and 9, 1x Odds on 4 and 10.</li>
<li>After Point is established, keep making $10 Come bets. Place Odds when Come bet moves to a number.</li>
<li>Continue using Come Bets until 4 numbers are established or just stop when you feel like it.</li>
</ol>
