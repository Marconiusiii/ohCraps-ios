<h3>$66 Inside Press</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $335</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $5-$15</p>
<p>Notes: Buy-in is based on initial $67 outlay for 5 shooters.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with $66 Inside bet; bet $15 each on the 5 and 9, $18 each on the 6 and 8. Bets are always working, point doesn't matter.</li>
<li>On first hit of any inside number, you'll win $21. Drop in $1 and press all inside numbers up 1 unit, or a $22 inside press. The 5 and 9 will be at $20 each, the 6 and 8 at $24 each, or $88 inside.</li>
<li>On the 2nd hit, use the winnings to do another full $22 inside press again and collect $6 in change. 5 and 9 will be at $25 each, 6 and 8 will be at $30 each, or $110 inside.</li>
<li>On the 3rd hit, press all numbers up again with a $22 Inside press and collect the change. 5 and 9 will be at $30 each, 6 and 8 will be at $36 each, or $132 Inside.</li>
<li>On the 4th hit, collect winnings and regress all bets back down to initial $66 Inside. Repeat entire strategy until a 7 out.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Modification</h4>
<ul role="list">
<li>All Inside numbers should win $42 on the 4th hit. Rather than regressing the bets, drop in $2 and do a full $44 Inside press, taking all inside numbers up 2 units each. The 5 and 9 should be at $40 each, the 6 and 8 at $48 each, or $176 Inside.</li>
<li>On the 5th hit, all inside numbers will pay out $56. Drop in $10 to do a full $66 Inside press on all inside numbers. 5 and 9 will be at $55 each, 6 and 8 will be at $66 each, or $242 inside.</li>
<li>The 6th hit will win $77 from the inside numbers. Drop in $11 more to do a full $88 press to take all inside bets up to 15 units each. The 5 and 9 will be at $75 each, the 6 and 8 will be at $90 each. When any of these hit at this level, immediately collect the winnings and regress all bets back down to $66 Inside and start strategy over. Tip your dealers!</li>
<li>These are just suggested progression levels. Feel free to play the table by ear and collect and regress at any of the levels after the 4th hit.</li>
