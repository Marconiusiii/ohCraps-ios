<h3>Trickle Up Method</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $600</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $5-$25</p>
<p>Notes: Similar to the 6 8 Funnel Press method, aiming to use the 5 and 9 to press the 6 and 8 up to collect from the two highest probability numbers to roll aside from the 7.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wait for a point to be established.</li>
<li>Bet $66 inside, or $15 each on the 5 and 9, $18 each on the 6 and 8.</li>
<li>Use wins on the 5 to help press the 6, and use wins on the 9 to help press the 8. The goal is to press whichever number hits and using what is left over to help get the 6 or 8 to $60 before starting to collect from the 6 or 8 wins.</li>
<li>If the 5 hits, $15 wins $21. Use the winnings to press the 5 up to $30, and the remaining $6 to press the 6 up to $24. Do the same with the 9 and 8 should the 9 roll.</li>
<li>If the 6 or 8 hit, use the winnings to press whichever one rolled up to $36 and collect the change.</li>
<li>A $30 Place 5 bet will win $42; use the winnings to press the 5 up to $50 and the 6 to $42, then collect the change. Mirror the same if this happens with the 8 and 9.</li>
<li>Use the next hit on the 5 or 6 to press the 6 up fully to $60. At this point with a $50 5 or 9 along with a $60 6 or 8, always collect the winnings when the 6 or 8 hit, and use $30 from hits on the 5 and 9 to continually press up the 6 or 8 while collecting the $40 in change. The $30 presses keep the 6 and 8 bets tidy and easy to pay out for the dealers and for you to keep track of.</li>
<li>If you have the bankroll available, you can add in the 4 and 10, beginning the system with $96 across and using wins to trickle up to pressing the 6 or 8. This would require a $1000 bankroll.</li>
