<h3>Ultimate Squeeze Play</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $1200-$2200</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $25</p>
<p>Notes: Get to $160 across in 2 hits for just $20.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wait for a point to be established.</li>
<li>Place $220 Inside, so $50 each on the 5 and 9, $60 each on the 6 and 8.</li>
<li>On the first hit of any inside number, you'll win $70. Use $50 of that to place the 4 and 10 for $25 each and collect the rest.</li>
<li>On the very next hit of any of the place numbers, immediately regress to $160 Across, or $25 on the 4, 5, 9, and 10 and $30 each on the 6 and 8.</li>
<li>At this point, you are only down $20. Feel free to start a double-tap press and collect method, or collect on the first hit of any place number to get out of the hand first, then start pressing and collecting.</li>
</ol>
