<h3>The Van Ben</h3>
<p>Buy-in: $2000</p>
<p>Table Minimum: $5-$15</p>
<p>Notes: Don't be afraid of the large bankroll and initial outlay of this method, as it just takes one hit to regress down and start building on opportunity. Be sure to tip the dealers well when playing this system since it takes a lot of work to keep it maintained. After the first hit on a pressed Place number, use the winnings to take the dealers across the Place numbers for $1 each under your control so they can play along with you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by placing $640 across; $100 each on the 4, 5, 9, and 10, $120 each on the 6 and 8. Bet a $4 Horn. Have all bets working on the Come Out roll.</li>
<li>If the Horn hits, immediately parley the winnings. If the Horn hits again on the Come Out, take all Place Bets down to $96 across and take down and collect the Horn bet.</li>
<li>If any of the Place numbers hit on the Come Out roll, immediately take all numbers down to $96 across; $15 each on the 4, 5 9, and 10, $18 each on the 6 and 8.</li>
<li>On the first hit of any place number now, use the winnings to do a full press on both that number and it's mate. If the 6 or 8 hits, drop in $3 to press them both up to $30 each. If the 5 or 9 hit, collect $1 and use the rest to press them both up to $25 each. If the 4 or 10 hit, drop in $1 and press them both to $30 each.</li>
<li>When one of the pressed Place numbers hit, collect the winnings, and then use the next hit to power press only that number. Continue on with a collect and power press system from here on out for all the Place numbers until you can get them to the table maximum.</li>
